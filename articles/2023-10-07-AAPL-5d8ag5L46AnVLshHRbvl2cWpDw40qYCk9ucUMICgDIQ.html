The Oracle of Omaha does not diversify his portfolio very well, but that doesn't mean you should follow suit.

Fool.com contributor Parkev Tatevosian highlights his thoughts on why Warren Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.36%) (BRK.B 0.37%) portfolio allocate a large percentage to only one stock.  
*Stock prices used were the afternoon prices of Oct. 4, 2023. The video was published on Oct. 6, 2023.
