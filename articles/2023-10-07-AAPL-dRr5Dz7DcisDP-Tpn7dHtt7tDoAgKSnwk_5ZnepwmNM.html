Learn More Â»AlexSecret Thesis summary Mega-caps stocks have been responsible for most of the market appreciation, but that doesn't actually mean they are expensive. If we look at PEG specifically, they are quite cheap. Given what's to come, there's a valid reason why mega-caps should trade at a premium. Out of the Magnificent seven, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands out, in my opinion, as offering the best value and the most promising outlook. Mega-caps are relatively cheap This year, we have witnessed the birth of the Magnificent 7, an extension of the original FAANG club. The magnificent 7 include Alphabet, Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Apple, Inc (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), and Meta Platforms (META) Mega-caps vs S&P (Adviser investments) It's easy to see in this chart that the mega-cap stocks have greatly outperformed the broader market. In fact, small-cap stocks in the Russell 2000 (IWM) are now pretty much flat over the last year, while META is up over 100% in the same time period. But just because the stocks have rallied doesn't mean they are overvalued. In fact, they might be historically undervalued after the last sell-off. PEG mega-caps vs S&P (Goldman) Measuring the PEG of the Mega Cap tech stocks vs the S&P 500. The magnificent 7 actually have an average PEG of 1.3, compared to an average PEG for the broader market of 1.9. This is the steepest "discount" since 2013 and is currently below the median over the last ten years. Magnificent 7; royal rumble From what I can see, the PEG ratio used by Goldman Sachs (GS) is the Non-GAAP FW PEG. Now, if we accept that the magnificent 7 are worth buying, which is the best in the pack?               GOOGL META TSLA AMZN AAPL NVDA MSFT   PEG Non-GAAP (FWD) 1,39 1,03 3,24 1,54 2,74 1,23 2,28   EV/EBITDA (FWD) 13,42 11,24 46,67 14,31 21,19 38,70 19,96   Price/Cash Flow (TTM) 17,23 14,17 59,40 21,19 24,01 91,42 27,06   Revenue 5 Year (CAGR) 18,50% 19,97% 47,03% 20,92% 8,51% 22,44% 13,94%   EPS Diluted 3 Year (CAGR) 27,57% 1,45% 200,38% -0,96% 21,81% 44,84% 18,89%   Click to enlarge Source: Seeking Alpha The table above compares all of the magnificent 7 on various metrics. Based on the PEG, META stands out as the most attractive, followed closely by NVDA and GOOGL. META once again wins on EV/EBITDA, with GOOGL coming in at a close second. These two companies once again excel in terms of Price/cash flow, and we can see quite a marked difference. While META and GOOGL trade at 14x and 17x cash flow the next best stock is AMZN at 21. In terms of revenue, TSLA and NVDA are in a league of their own. The rapid growth over the last five years has also translated into very high EPS growth. Tesla grew EPS by 200%, NVDA by 44.8%, and in third place, GOOGL. Each investor has his own set of preferences, but if you ask me, GOOGL is the mega-cap tech stock that offers the best balance of growth, valuation and is probably the best set-up for what comes next. GOOGL is well set up for what comes next Higher rates have been driving down the market. It seems like higher for longer could actually be a lot longer, so how should investors prepare for this new environment? If credit is going to be tight, and this may possibly lead to a recession, then a strong balance sheet is a must. Look no further than GOOGL. Google assets (Alpha spread) Google liabilities (Alpha spread) With $383 billion in assets and only $116 in liabilities, GOOGL has a fortress balance sheet. The company also boasts $118 billion in cash and short-term investments. These will come in very handy in the coming years. 1 month T-bills are paying 5.56% right now. This means GOOGL could be adding over $6.5 billion yearly just from holding T-bills. Solvency ratios (Alpha spread) GOOGL is incredibly strong in all solvency measures, and in fact, it is the strongest of the magnificent 7.               GOOGL META TSLA AMZN AAPL NVDA MSFT   Debt/Free Cash Flow 1,70 3,59 12,68 14,62 3,03 2,22 4,35   Long Term Debt/Total Capital 8,92% 20,70% 6,56% 42,44% 57,84% 24,70% 24,71%   Current Ratio 2,17 2,32 1,59 0,95 0,98 2,79 1,77   Quick Ratio 2,02 2,20 0,97 0,67 0,81 2,23 1,54   Click to enlarge Source: Seeking Alpha GOOGL has the best debt/FCF and LT debt to Capital. It is beaten by META and NVDA on current and quick ratio, but this is not as important. The other great thing about GOOGL is its revenue diversification. Alphabet revenue distribution (Statista) Though half the revenues still come from the US, it has a strong presence in Europe, The Middle East and Africa, and also in ASIA. The revenue diversification doesn't only apply to geographies but also to its segments: Alphabet revenue by segment (FourweekMBA) While a little over half of revenues still comes from ads, there are a lot of other sources of revenue, including Google Cloud, YouTube, and Google Other. Google is a lot more than just an ad company. It has a global footprint and essentially a monopoly on the internet. 93% of all web traffic passes through Google. This company is not going anywhere. Risks The only real risk with Google doesn't come from the market but from regulators. Google is too big for many countries' liking, making it a target in various lawsuits. Just last month, UK consumers launched a multi-billion pound lawsuit against the company. But the fact that GOOGL can just shrug these off is a testament to just how powerful this company is. Final Thoughts  I think there's a good reason why the magnificent 7 have rallied while other stocks have not. For better and for worse, the big are getting bigger, and there is no bigger than GOOGL. This is a must-own stock, in my opinion, and it makes for a very good recession play thanks to its strong balance sheet and revenue resilience. GOOGL is perhaps the highest conviction stock in my End Of The World Portfolio.This article was written byJames Foord17.93K FollowersFollowJames Foord is an economist by trade and has been analyzing global markets for the past decade.

Amazon is a play on large margin growth in the future, and is sitting below historical P/OCF, so looks undervalued.  I own a lot of Google but honestly haven't looked at the valuation for a while.  These things might trade sideways a few years until inflation dies down, then as baby boomers retire and AI/robots start taking jobs, the low rate, deflationary aspects will come back to make tech great again.ReplyLikeDividend AmbassadorYesterday, 11:38 AMPremiumComments (9.01K)You could routinely buy MSFT at 8-9 times free cash flow to equity from 2010-2013.  It could happen again.  MSFT now trades at 40 times free cash flow to equity.  MSFT was significantly undervalued from 2020-2013.  It is significantly overvalued now.  The best time to accumulate a robust position in MSFT was from 2010-2013. That is when I was a buyer.  I will buy again if history repeats itself and MSFT again trades at 8-9 time free cash flow to equity.  I will let you guys buy MSFT here.  I might even sell you some of my shares!ReplyLike(4)LLambsupYesterday, 2:01 PMInvesting GroupComments (764)@Dividend Ambassador I agree, sold 75% of my MSFT position this year and will add more I am sure at some point but buying in now or holding a 100% position at current valuations seems suboptimal for most investors.ReplyLikeMean Reversion InvestorYesterday, 4:04 PMAnalystPremiumComments (942)@Dividend Ambassador might happen. But what was MSFT in 2010/2013?  Running an old operating system company.  Had to reinvent itself or else it might stillBe trading at those valuations. And knowing if a company can reinvent itself to justify buying the stock is always a gamble. Not all companies do.ReplyLikejjustaguy11Yesterday, 9:06 AMComments (1.86K)Megacaps are cheap.  LOL.ReplyLike(1)ddstbYesterday, 6:52 AMInvesting GroupComments (6.64K)GOOG is fully valued.  Apple is still overvalued unless you are highly bullish on the current iPhone cycle. To value Nvidia you must accept huge future demand for their chips and that the AI craze wonât fade at least temporarily.  And Amazon is as always quite overvalued with not enough visibility into much needed consistent margin expansion.ReplyLikeLLambsupYesterday, 2:05 PMInvesting GroupComments (764)@dstb META is the outlier to me- GOOG is my largest position but META is interesting- it would be valued like MSFT or APPL if not for its splurge into more speculative things but with its FCF, whatever it did with that money would by nature have to be somewhat high risk to make it worth doing vs returning money to shareholders. AMZN could slow investment and become a FCF monster but given its company culture, that does not seem likely in the near term. I do think AMZN longs are likely to be rewarded eventually but I also think there are likely to be better entry points for those still accumulating.ReplyLikeddstbYesterday, 4:14 PMInvesting GroupComments (6.64K)@Lambsup I have GOOG, AAPL and AMZN in that order by size of position.  All bought between 2008 & 2010.  Amazon used to be my largest and I began selling awhile ago.  It is now my 4th largest.  Apple then became my largest and I sold that down below Alphabet.  I also owned a much smaller META position for awhile.  On META I got out because I do not trust management.  The metaverse push out of nowhere was ridiculous and I do not believe management was being honest about how much of a negative effect the iOS tracking changes were having on the ad business.  In the conference calls they seemed vague about how they were going to fix that issue and at the same time magically pushing into metaverse spending.  Did not feel like a coincidence. I like Apple as a company but their growth is lower and less consistent than the others although they have much better spending discipline.  I figure it is worth mid-$130s and given that and size of position is why I've been selling.With Amazon I don't buy into "they could slow investment thing" which I hear a lot.  It might be the most capital intensive company on earth now.  It was not like that when I bought.  They are into everything.  Too much complexity makes it almost impossible to keep an eye on the ball.  I think they need the content investment now to keep people coming to Prime but more orders mean higher shipping costs.  The retail model is flawed.  At first AWS looked awesome when there was little competition but that is over.  This is now a commodity business that will also but downward pressure on margins over time.  The margin bump this year seems to come mostly from the reduction in headcount which will not be sustainable and they have wage pressures everywhere.  Given all of this I cannot wrap my head around the valuation.  I don't go for the sum of the parts approach either.  Give me consistent margin growth but I don't think it is possible for Amazon.Sorry for the long one.  Cheers.ReplyLike(2)Tony Montana MunichYesterday, 4:32 AMComments (1.04K)Buffett on Google:youtu.be/...ReplyLike(3)uunderscorerealityYesterday, 12:32 PMInvesting GroupComments (1.07K)@Tony Montana Munich thanks for sharingReplyLike(1)InvestInMETA07 Oct. 2023PremiumComments (5.35K)Iâm pretty much a permabull and even I donât think the magnificent 7 are cheapâ¦ReplyLike(5)rppearsonYesterday, 3:21 PMPremiumComments (1.9K)@InvestInMETA Is META the âcheapest â..?ReplyLikerppearson07 Oct. 2023PremiumComments (1.9K)Thank youReplyLikeppbsc07 Oct. 2023Comments (6)Of course things will look cheap when you compare them to only the last 6 years of history, a time of record low interest rates.
