Analyst Pins Hope On Key Jobs Data This Weekby Shanthi Rexaline, Benzinga Editor October 4, 2023 7:27 AM |  5 min read Zinger Key PointsThe relentless rise in the yield on the 10-year US T-note continues, as it hit a fresh 16-year high 4.887%.Asian stocks wilted, taking cues from Wall Street, and European stocks are fighting to stay afloat in early trading.The negative sentiment that has enveloped the equity market in recent sessions persists amid a lack of clarity regarding the interest rate trajectory. Stock futures point to a narrowly mixed start on Wednesday. A labor market reading, some service sector activity data, and a couple of Federal Reserve speeches are among the key market-moving events of the session. Oil prices tumbled, potentially weighing down on energy stocks. Risk aversion may also come into play amid the brewing political uncertainty following the ouster of Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif) as House Speaker. If the data points support a pullback in yields, bargain hunting could kick in, setting the stage for the averages to bounce back from their four-month lows.Cues From Tuesday’s Trading:Stubbornly high bond yields and data showing much more than expected job openings for August aggravated the market weakness on Tuesday. The major averages opened lower and fell sharply in the morning session. The selling pressure decelerated in the afternoon session and yet the indices closed notably lower for the session.The major averages all pulled back to a four-month low, while the Russell 2000 Index ended at its lowest since March 23.The selling was broad-based, although defensive utility stocks gained some ground. Real estate, financial, IT, consumer discretionary, and communication services stocks were among the worst hit.

"Investors are sick and tired of being jerked around with out-of-control spending, the inability to govern, and the constant dragging of markets to the edge of economic calamity with shutdowns and debt ceiling nonsense," said Jamie Cox, Managing Partner, at Harris Financial Group.Futures Today Futures Performance On WednesdayFuturesPerformance (+/-)Nasdaq 100-0.12%S&P 500+0.05%Dow+0.02%R2K-0.33%In premarket trading on Wednesday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY edged down 0.05% to $421.38 and the Invesco QQQ ETF QQQ fell 0.13% to $354.47, according to Benzinga Pro data.Upcoming Economic Data:The ADP is due to release the results of its private payroll survey for September.
