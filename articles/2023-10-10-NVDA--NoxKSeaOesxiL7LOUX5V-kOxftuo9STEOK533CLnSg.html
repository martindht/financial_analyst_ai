Stocks are on the rise, as yields go tumbling. Reopening after a holiday, bonds are rallying in part due to haven seeking after Hamas’ deadly attacks on Israel. But also, two Fed officials talked down interest rate hikes on Monday — more speakers are ahead for Tuesday. Investors, especially oil traders, will obviously be monitoring the Middle East for any escalation, but Wall Street has a way of quickly and coldly getting back to business, as inflation data and the start of earnings season loom.

Onto our our call of the day from Goldman Sachs, which says that an influential crowd of momentum traders is ready to buy the S&P 500 in a big way over the next month.  The below chart from the bank shows record-low exposure for U.S. equities among commodity trading advisors, or CTAs, who profit from bets on futures markets, and often follow trends. According to a note from the bank, these CTAs are short some $90 billion of global equities, what it says is a zero percentile reading. In the U.S. alone, they are short $47 billion in equities — the largest U.S. short position for this group on record.  “Per GS model, [the] CTAs are now buyers of SPX in every scenario over the next month,” said the bank in an note from Monday.







Positioning in U.S. stocks by CTAs is at a record low of $47 billion.

So those CTAs who have been busy selling the S&P 500, are ready to buy it back if Goldman is right. However, not everyone advises following the trend-loving CTAs, who some criticize for often swinging from one extreme to the other.  As the FT has pointed out, CTAs had a record 2022 performance thanks to surging inflation, but got burned earlier this year on bets that bank turmoil would force the Fed to stop hiking interest rates.  MarketWatch’s Mark Hulbert notes that while October can be a historically volatile month, it can also mark the start of a seasonal bounce for stocks. Jeff Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader’s Almanac & Almanac Investor Newsletter, refers to October as a “bear-killer, bargain month and turnaround month,” with solid, though yes, volatile trading at times. This seasonality chart from Equity Clock that has been making the rounds may also support stock buyers:
