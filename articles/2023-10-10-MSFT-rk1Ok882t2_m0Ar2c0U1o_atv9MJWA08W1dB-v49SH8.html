History shows that after a weak September, the stock market can rally in the fourth quarter.

A report by Bank of America shows that when the stock market has rallied 15% through July, we typically see an 8% pullback from August to September, which is then followed by a Q4 rally.
In today's video, I am going to discuss five dividend stocks, including the likes of Nvidia (NVDA 1.16%), that can ride the year-end rally.
Check out this short video to learn more, consider subscribing to the channel, and check out the special offer in the link below.
*Stock prices used were end-of-day prices of Oct. 6, 2023. The video was published on Oct. 9, 2023.
