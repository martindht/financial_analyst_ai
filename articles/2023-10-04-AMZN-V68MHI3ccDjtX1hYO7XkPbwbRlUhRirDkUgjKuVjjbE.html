Project Kuiper Seeks SatCom Licenseby Shomik Sen Bhattacharjee, Benzinga Staff Writer October 4, 2023 7:17 AM |  2 min read This story was first published on the Benzinga India portal.Amazon.com Inc AMZN is preparing to delve into India's satellite communications industry, hot on the heels of Elon Musk's Starlink. According to well-placed sources, the e-commerce behemoth is on the verge of seeking a satellite communications service operator's license for its Project Kuiper.In recent dialogues between Amazon and the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), the focus has been on anticipating potential stumbling blocks prior to the formal application. An inside source confided to Indian news publisher Mint, "Amazon plans to lodge the license application shortly and is hopeful of securing approval."This license would enable corporations to offer satellite-based internet services, with sectors like maritime and aviation communications standing to benefit.An Amazon spokesperson underscored their eagerness to partner with the Indian government and local bodies to address nationwide connectivity shortcomings.See Also: Disney Star Set To Score 4,000 Cr From Cricket World Cup Ads: Report

In the race for satellite internet supremacy, competitors such as Starlink and Bharti Enterprises-supported OneWeb have already thrown their hats in the ring. Also joining the competition is Jio Satellite Communications, the satellite broadband subsidiary of Reliance Jio, which obtained its license last year.Amazon has recently publicized the launch of its prototype satellites and trials. The company's ambitious Project Kuiper is aimed at deploying low-earth orbit satellites to bolster internet connectivity, particularly in isolated regions.Amazon's strategic foray has been in the works for nearly two years. Capitalizing on its extensive enterprise network, specifically its cloud services via Amazon Web Services, the firm is looking to establish a significant foothold in this burgeoning market.Nonetheless, the industry is keenly awaiting clarity on satellite spectrum allocation. While some are championing administrative allocation, others, including Reliance Jio, are advocating for auctioning. This decision will have a crucial role in determining the competitive dynamics of India's satellite communications sector.Read Next: Trevor Noah Thanks Indian Fans Vows To Return To Bengaluru For 'Best Show Ever' After Cancellation © 2023 Benzinga.com.
