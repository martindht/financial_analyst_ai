Of 672 Firms, Top Tech Analyst Picks Favorite 2by Anusuya Lahiri, Benzinga Editor October 10, 2023 12:46 PM |  2 min read Which is the top AI firm? Wedbush analyst Dan Ives had a proprietary AI survey of 672 enterprises.The survey says Microsoft Corp MSFT followed by Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL Google are early leaders, while Amazon.Com Inc AMZN and Meta Platforms Inc META will likely narrow the gap. Also Read: Despite OpenAI's Potential Shift, Citi Analyst Predicts Nvidia's Continued Dominance in AI GPU MarketOne of the top takeaways from the survey was Microsoft taking the early lead in the race with its OpenAI acquisition as the company has a significant AI monetization opportunity within Azure through Microsoft Co-Pilot while Google is also being viewed as a critical Generative AI player now and down the road as it further improves Bard and its PaLM/LaMDA LLMs. Both Microsoft and Google appear to be in the AI driver's seat, which will be a battle over the next decade as we expect other technology companies such as Amazon, Meta, Nvidia Corp NVDA, Apple Inc AAPL, and other tech stalwarts along with smaller players in the industry to collectively spend billions in this AI arms race over the coming years. 27% of overall decision makers view Microsoft as the top player currently in this Generative AI arms race vs. 24% for Google, with the other players well behind, proving for now that the rest are playing catch up. 

Ives' conclusions from this Wedbush Proprietary Enterprise Generative AI Survey favor Google, Microsoft, and the myriad of tech players globally that are heavily investing in developing Generative AI products/solutions for enterprises as the use cases and monetization opportunities continue to increase. The survey results reflect the very early innings of integrating these Generative AI products like LLMs and Chatbots into the enterprise space as implementation will likely significantly grow over the next 3-5 years.Price Action: MSFT shares traded higher by 0.14% at $330.28 on the last check Tuesday.EarningsAnalyst RatingsOptionsDividendsIPOsClick to see more Analyst Ratings updates© 2023 Benzinga.com.
