  Critical information for the U.S. trading day
 












Taylor Swift taught fans to “Shake it off.” Investors could take a page out of that playbook, as the bar is low for positive economic surprises, says HSBC.

Are investors on the brink of losing a hard-fought recovery for the stock market this year? September is about to deliver the S&P 500’s 
        SPX
       worst monthly performance of 2023 — a 5.1% drop (December 2022 saw a 5.8% tumble.) Thanks for nothing, bond yields and King Dollar.  If the index can hang onto the 11% return earned so far this year, that’s better than 2022, but maybe not the rebound many hoped for. And rising fear among investors could make the next three months tough, especially as bad news is now bad news.

Over to our call of the day, where a team at HSBC led by chief multi-asset strategist Max Kettner, says things are so gloomy, an upside surprise shouldn’t be ruled out. “Our recent conversations have not been short of pushbacks on potential downsidecatalysts — from a post-Taylor Swift/Beyoncé consumer spending hangover and numerous others,” say Kettner and the team, who draw upon Swift’s work to headline the note, “Shake it off.” And while the catalyst for the latest pullback in risk assets is mirroring those of 2022 — higher yields and higher-for-longer restrictive monetary policy, they see one big distinction. “The key difference to last year’s rates-driven selloffs is that it hasn’t happened in anticipation of a significant slowdown in growth, but instead due to growth still being too resilient, in particular in the U.S,” said the HSBC strategists in a note to clients. “As a result, credit spreads have also remained much more stable compared with equities.”  Credit spreads offer a looking glass into the health of businesses and their access to capital. Here’s the HSBC chart that lays out what’s been happening:








            HSBC
          



How to play this? HSBC is sticking to an overweight on U.S. equities, and has lifted their exposure to energy due to “attractive carry” (potential profit to be earned from just owning an asset), with a nudge toward the U.K. due to its exposure to that sector.  Apart from faith in U.S. stocks, they broadly prefer U.S. over European risk assets headed into the fourth quarter. “The reason is simple: near-term consensus growth expectations for the U.S. are still very low – similar to the last couple of quarters. So the bar for positive surprises remains pretty low.” For example, Kettner and Co. say it’s really hard to see any negative surprises in the next three to six months, and their own economists predict higher fourth-quarter and first-quarter U.S. growth and also fewer rate cuts in 2024 and 2025 than consensus. Inflation will head higher in the fourth quarter.  The big changes to sentiment that has put the S&P 500 on a slippery slope have been U.S. rates pricing, a dollar comeback and higher energy prices. Here, HSBC pushes back on a few more concerns among investors: 








            HSBC says markets are worrying too much about consumer credit and delinquencies.
          



 
Excess savings running low among U.S. consumers. HSBC argues that real wage growth has been positive for some time, and low-income consumers have not been left out of that. Also, rising risk assets have like led to a “positive wealth effect for U.S. households.”


       
Rising consumer credit. They point out that consumer credit is rising at a slower pace than 2021 and 2022. “In any case, it’s often a variable that is used as a bearish argument, regardless of the direction.”


       
Increased credit card delinquencies. While delinquencies have been rising since late 2022, the level is “barely” where it was before COVID-19 and “nowhere near the pre-GFC [Global Financial Crisis] average yet.”


       
Student loan debt moratorium expiration. As HSBC explains, those repayments have temporarily spiked higher since early July, but have since reverted down, and some fear this will restrain spending. “We wouldn’t be that negative though: the fact that debtors repaid student debt ahead of the expiration of the moratorium shows that indeed consumers still have money left to spend.”


       
Wobbly job market. The strategists point out that a year ago, overwhelming consensus was for a first-half recession, Fed pivot and second-half recovery. Nonfarm payrolls, they note, grew 190,000 in August, initial jobless claims are less than 20,000 away from a record low seen a year ago and job openings remain about 1.5 million above their pre-COVID 19 peak. “This hardly qualifies as weaker.”
