Kumar had an Overweight rating on Apple Inc AAPL with a price target of $220.Apple's share of smartphone ownership remains near record highs in Piper Sandler's Taking Stock with Teens Fall 2023 survey (note). Of the ~9,200 respondents, 87% have an iPhone, slightly below the 88% record set in the Spring 2021 survey. In addition, the iPhone could return to record highs due to the 88% purchase intention among teens. Kumar notes over 23% of teens plan to upgrade to an iPhone 15 this Fall/Winter, slightly below the 25% purchase intention for the iPhone 14 last spring. Apple's other hardware metrics also showed strong results, with more than 34% of teens already owning an Apple Watch and 72% owning AirPods near record highs.
