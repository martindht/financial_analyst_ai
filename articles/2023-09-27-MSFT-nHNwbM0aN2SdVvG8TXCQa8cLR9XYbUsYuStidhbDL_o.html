Technology stocks helped drive a rally in U.S. stocks this year that took Wall Street analysts by surprise. Now, their gains are fading even more quickly. The S&P 500 Information Technology sector 
        CO:IUIT
       entered correction territory on Tuesday when it finished off 10.5% from its 52-week closing high of 3,207.29 reached on July 18, according to FactSet data. Wall Street analysts define a correction as a 10% drop from a recent high. The information-technology sub-index finished at 2,869.64 on Tuesday after declining 1.8% during a market rout that saw every one of the S&P 500’s 11 sectors finish lower. 

For practically all of 2023, information technology stocks have been the second-best performers on the S&P 500 index, surpassed only by the communications services sector, which is heavily weighted toward a handful of the so-called  “Magnificent Seven” technology and media stocks that have driven much of this year’s rally.  Communications services 
        XX:SP500.50
       stocks have fallen only 5.2% from their highs as shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. 
        META,
        -0.69%
       and Google parent Alphabet Inc. 
        GOOG,
        +1.14%
GOOGL,
        +1.19%
       have weathered this latest bout of market volatility with only modest losses.  Meanwhile, the megacap stocks in the information technology sector have fared much worse recently. Nvidia Corp. 
        NVDA,
        +1.20%,
       this year’s artificial intelligence software market darling, has fallen nearly 9% over the past month, while Apple Inc. 
        AAPL,
        -1.21%
       and Microsoft Corp. 
        MSFT,
        +0.03%
       have each lost more than 3%. Other major components of the information technology sector have brooked serious losses as well, most notably Oracle Corp. 
        ORCL,
        -0.40%,
       which has fallen 9.6% over the past month following a disappointing earnings report and guidance.  Both information technology and communications services are still holding on to strong year-to-date gains, up 32.1% and 38.1%, respectively, compared with an 11.3% gain for the S&P 500.  While tech stocks suffered bigger losses in August and earlier in September, other sectors have actually outpaced their losses over the past week. Both the real estate and consumer discretionary sectors have fallen nearly 6% over the past five days, FactSet data show, compared with a drop of 4.3% for information technology. Real-estate stocks have fallen nearly 20% from their Feb. 2 highs, putting them on the cusp of a bear market.  The S&P 500 
        SPX
       still has a few percentage points to go before entering correction territory. According to FactSet data, it has fallen 6.9% through Tuesday’s close from its 52-week closing high of 4,588.96, reached on July 31.
