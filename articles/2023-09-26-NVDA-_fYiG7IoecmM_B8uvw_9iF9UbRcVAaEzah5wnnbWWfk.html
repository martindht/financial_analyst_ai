Bank of America anticipates Meta's announcement of AI agents for consumers and businesses. Meta Platforms, Inc. META is set to unveil groundbreaking advancements at its annual Connect developer conference, scheduled for Sept. 27-28.Among the anticipated highlights is the official launch of Quest 3, a virtual reality headset promising to redefine the VR experience. Beyond Quest 3, attendees and enthusiasts are eager for updates on Horizon Worlds and the tantalizing possibility of new AR glasses.AI Agents And Investment ProspectsBank of America is adding fuel to the excitement, speculating that Meta could introduce early versions of AI agents designed for consumers and businesses. These agents may include chatbots with personas, content creation tools, advertiser resources, and customer service solutions. While initially more relevant for Facebook, Instagram, and messaging services, these AI agents are expected to play a pivotal role in driving engagement, interaction with businesses, and ad revenues across the Metaverse.Bank of America’s equity analyst Justin Post outlines four key areas that investors will closely scrutinize during the event:
The justification for Meta’s unprecedented Metaverse platform investment, estimated at $18.4 billion in total expenses for 2023.
The presence of developer momentum and compelling Metaverse content that could alter the Metaverse narrative.
Meta’s AI innovation that holds the potential to boost engagement and enhance ad targeting across its platforms.
Clues about prospective investment spending plans for 2024, a vital element for investor confidence.
